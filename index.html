                                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. Some cause illness in people, and 
                                    others, such as canine and feline coronaviruses, only infect animals. Rarely, 
                                    animal coronaviruses that infect animals have emerged to infect people and can 
                                    spread between people. This is suspected to have occurred for the virus that 
                                    causes COVID-19. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute 
                                    Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are two other examples of coronaviruses that 
                                    originated from animals and then spread to people. More information about the 
                                    source and spread of COVID-19 is available on the <a href="#">Situation Summary:

                                    The patient has tested negative on at least two consecutive respiratory specimens collected at least 24 hours apart.

                                    It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of 
                                    COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during 
                                    cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with 
                                    these viruses during other months. At this time, it is not known whether the 
                                    spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer. There is much more 
                                    to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with 
                                    COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.

                                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person 
                                    through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support 
                                    transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating 
                                    food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 
                                    seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after 
                                    blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or 
                                    object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or 
                                    possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus 
                                    spreads.

                                    In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, 
                                    there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that 
                                    are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen 
                                    temperatures.

                                    the WHO website and through your national and local public health authority.
                                    Many countries around the world have seen cases of COVID-19 and several 
                                    have seen outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have 
                                    succeeded in slowing or stopping their outbreaks. However, the situation 
                                    is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.</p>
                                <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking 
                                    some simple precautions:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand 
                                        rub or wash them with soap and water.
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Why?</strong> Washing your hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand 
                                        rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
                                    <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who 
                                        is coughing or sneezing.
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Why?</strong> When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from 
                                        their nose or mouth which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can 
                                        breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing 
                                        has the disease.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth.
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Why?</strong> Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, 
                                        hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the 
                                        virus can enter your body and can make you sick.</li>
                                    <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. 
                                        This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when 
                                        you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue immediately.
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Why?</strong> Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect 
                                        the people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.</li>
                                    <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, 
                                        seek medical attention and call in advance. Follow the directions of your local health 
                                        authority.
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Why?</strong> National and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the 
                                        situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care provider to quickly 
                                        direct you to the right health facility. This will also protect you and help prevent 
                                        spread of viruses and other infections.</li>
                                    <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 
                                        is spreading widely). If possible, avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an
                                        older person or have diabetes, heart or lung disease.
                                        <br>
                                        <strong>Why?</strong> You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one of these areas.</li>

                                        instructions for medication(s) and care. You should help the patient with basic needs in the

                                        Monitor the patient’s symptoms. If the patient is getting sicker, call his or her healthcare 
                                        provider and tell them that the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the 
                                        healthcare provider’s office take steps to keep other people in the office or waiting room from 
                                        getting infected. Ask the healthcare provider to call the local or state health department for 
                                        additional guidance. If the patient has a medical emergency and you need to call 911, notify 
                                        the dispatch personnel that the patient has, or is being evaluated for COVID-19.

                                        use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains 60 to 95% alcohol, covering all surfaces of your hands 
                                        and rubbing them together until they feel dry. Soap and water should be used preferentially if hands are

                                    If you are at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, you should: stock up on supplies; take everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others; when you go out in public, keep away from others who are sick; limit close contact and wash your hands often; and avoid crowds, cruise travel, and non-essential travel. If there is an outbreak in your community, stay home as much as possible. Watch for symptoms and emergency signs. If you get sick, stay home and call your doctor.

                                    Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19. Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so WHO urges people to use masks wisely.

                                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                                    The process and locations for testing vary from place to place. Contact your state, local, tribal, or territorial department for more information, or reach out to a medical provider. State and local public health departments have received tests from CDC while medical providers are getting tests developed by commercial manufacturers. While supplies of these tests are increasing, it may still be difficult to find someplace to get tested.

                                    Outbreaks can be stressful for adults and children. Talk with your children about the outbreak, try to stay calm, and reassure them that they are safe. If appropriate, explain to them that most illness from COVID-19 seems to be mild.

                                    This is a new virus and we are still learning about it, but so far, there does not seem to be a lot of illness in children. Most illness, including serious illness, is happening in adults of working age and older adults. If there cases of COVID-19 that impact your child’s school, the school may dismiss students. Keep track of school dismissals in your community. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals. If schools are dismissed temporarily, use alternative childcare arrangements, if needed.

                                    If your child/children become sick with COVID-19, notify their childcare facility or school. Talk with teachers about classroom assignments and activities they can do from home to keep up with their schoolwork.

                                    Depending on the situation, public health officials may recommend community actions to reduce exposures to COVID-19, such as school dismissals. Read or watch local media sources that report school dismissals or and watch for communication from your child’s school. If schools are dismissed temporarily, discourage students and staff from gathering or socializing anywhere, like at a friend’s house, a favorite restaurant, or the local shopping mall.

                                    Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through respiratory droplets. Currently there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.

                                    It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In general, because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces, there is likely very low risk of spread from food products or packaging that are shipped over a period of days or weeks at ambient, refrigerated, or frozen temperatures.

                                    Follow the advice of your local health officials. Stay home if you can. Talk to your employer to discuss working from home, taking leave if you or someone in your household gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms, or if your child’s school is dismissed temporarily. Employers should be aware that more employees may need to stay at home to care for sick children or other sick family members than is usual in case of a community outbreak.

                                    From the evidence so far, the COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in ALL AREAS, including areas with hot and humid weather. Regardless of climate, adopt protective measures if you live in, or travel to an area reporting COVID-19. The best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is by frequently cleaning your hands. By doing this you eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that could occur by then touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.

                                    There is no reason to believe that cold weather can kill the new coronavirus or other diseases. The normal human body temperature remains around 36.5°C to 37°C, regardless of the external temperature or weather. The most effective way to protect yourself against the new coronavirus is by frequently cleaning your hands with alcohol-based hand rub or washing them with soap and water.

To protect yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.
